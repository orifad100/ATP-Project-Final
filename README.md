# ATP-Project-Final

C# project - Advanced Topic in Programming course, 2nd semester, 2nd year.

This project was done as part of the “Advanced Topic in Programming course”, The aim of the project is to build a maze computer game which is based on algorithms.

The project is divided into 3 tasks:

Task A: You were to translate a pseudo-code of an object-oriented programming algorithm by maintaining Solid principles.
We used a pseudo-code of the PRIME algorithm to implement the maze. Mark the lines that depend on the problem. These lines defined for us the functionality required by the problem definition. We will define this functionality in a special interface for the general problem. Later concrete classes will implement this interface and thus define different specific problems. Keeping this rule will allow the algorithm to work against the type of the interface instead of against the type of a specific class. The polymorphism feature will allow us to replace different implementations of the problem without having to change anything in the code of the algorithm

After building the maze we are interested in solving the maze using 3 different algorithms :
